# London Bike Rides: Data Visualization and Analysis

This project explores and visualizes London bike-sharing data using Python and Tableau to uncover patterns in ridership, weather conditions, and time-based trends.

## Project Problem & Objectives

The goal of this project is to analyze how weather conditions and temporal factors influence public bike usage in London. By visualizing patterns such as temperature, wind speed, and time-of-day effects, the project aims to:

- Uncover correlations between weather variables and ridership
- Identify high and low demand periods
- Support urban mobility planning using historical trends

---

## Project Overview

Using a dataset from Kaggle, this project focuses on:

- Building an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze bike ridership in London
- Identifying trends in temperature, wind speed, and ride counts
- Visualizing how weather conditions and time of day impact ride volume

---

## Data Source

Dataset: [London Bike Sharing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset)  
- Records: 17,414 entries  
- Columns include: Timestamp, temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather conditions, and number of rides

---

## Visualizations

Tableau Dashboard Highlights:
- 14-Day Moving Average of ride counts across a multi-year span
- Heatmap comparing ride volume against temperature and wind speed
- Breakdown by Hour & Weather Type to show high-traffic periods and weather-based behavior patterns

## Tools & Technologies

- Python: Data cleaning and preprocessing using `pandas`
- Jupyter Notebook: Analysis pipeline
- Tableau Public: Dashboard creation and interactive visual storytelling
- Excel: Manual inspection and quick data wrangling

---

## Key Insights

- Peak ridership occurred during mild temperatures (~9-12°C) and moderate wind speeds (6–10 kph)
- Morning and evening rush hours (7–9 AM and 4–6 PM) saw the highest usage
- Clear and broken cloud conditions correlated with higher ride volumes than rainy or overcast conditions
